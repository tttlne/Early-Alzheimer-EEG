  In this project, we employ feature extraction methods to observe potential biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease basedon multi-channel EEG signal data. Subsequently,spectrogramimages are generated and used as input for a deep learning model to classify two categories in the dataset. MCI and NORMAL.
  We used the data set from https://misp.mui.ac.ir/en/eeg-data-0 consisting of 61 patients, including 29 inthe MCI group and 32 in the NC group. Data were recordedbased on the 10–20 International System using a 32-channeldigital EEG device with a 256 Hz sampling rate (Galileo NT,EBneuro, Italy). Each recording includes 19 channels and lastsapproximately 1800 seconds.
